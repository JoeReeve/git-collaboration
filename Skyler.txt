Hello, my name is Skyler Ramussen. I am a Senior CS Major graduating this upcoming fall semester. Currenlty I am working at the PCC as one of theweb developers on their Marketing and ECommerce teams. This semester I hope to gain skills necessary to find a job after graduation.\n For my final project my idea is to create a Equipment Rentals Application. In both high school as well as here at BYUH I have worked at jobs that rented out equipment such as kayaks, paddleboads, surfboards, volleyball nets, camping gear, and more. In each of these jobs, the methods of maintaing and organizing inventory, rentals, and reservations were all outdated and messy. I hope to create a system that is organized and easy to manipulate with a front end web application. In the future, if given more time, I also hope to work on react native in order to create mobile application versions as well to help ease of use. My project will include Users, Equipment, Reservations, and Current Rentals.
