My name is Naleo, and I am currently taking CS490R.  I have grown up in Laie,
and hope to be able to continue studying CS to later get a good job.

My project idea is an application for school scheduling, specifically for very
small schools or homeschools.  It will have users, assignments, subjects, and
school years, possibly more.  I hope to write a web frontend for this project,
and time permitting, some react native mobile apps.
